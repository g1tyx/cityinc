                        <br/>
                        <p class="bold text-left">Simply put, you earn citizens by making lots of money.  You will get your first citizen when you have about a 44 billion dollar net worth. However, you'll only receive their bonus after you started a new city.  So, that brings us onto our next subject.</p>

                        <h3>Why should I restart/start new city?</h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p class="bold text-left">
                          When you do start to earn citizens, you need to prestige, or restart your city, to earn their bonus. Every citizen gives you a 2% bonus to what you earn.  This means that if you have 10 upcoming citizens, and restart, you will get an extra 20 cents per dollar per citizen giving you a total of $1.2.  This does not sound like a lot, but it adds up later in the game.

                        <p class="bold text-left">
                          This question is up to you, and there is not just one answer. Some prefer to restart as soon as they get a citizen, while some like to do a restart after receiving 10 citizens. Either way, you'll get 2% increase in profit for each citizen, and you get to keep your citizens when you restart.<br/><br/>
                          
                          Remember that the only thing that will follow you to a new city is the citizens themselves, and your collected coins. All upgrades will reset.

                          The only thing that follows you to a new city is the citizens themselves and your coins. Everything else resets. But, it is VERY much worth it since each one the citizens gives you a huge bonus.

                          If you keep the approval rating high enough, you will receive a bonus. The amount of the bonus depends on how high the approval ratings are and are stated just below the ratings bar. The approval ratings ticks down during a set amount of time, and will need to be filled up after a few hours. But, remember: The bonus is only available as long as you are online in the game.

                          Debates are a version of the card game 21, where you have to come as close to 21 as possible, without going over it.  However, you still have to beat your opponent.  To raise the number of votes, you can choose to “argue” about three different issues.  These issues will pick a random number between their limits, and raise your votes by that number.
