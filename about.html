              <li>The game now remembers City Specialization between resets. However you need to get the upgrade "open the parliment" for it to follow over. Thanks to /u/HighPriestofShiloh for the suggestion.</li>
              <li>Total money per second is now displayed on the front page after you bought the road politician. (Thanks to /u/harald705, /u/reddjt, /u/KBKWilliamsson, Bill and a bunch of other awesome people for the suggestion)</li>

              <li>A timer since last reset has been added to the statistics page. (Thanks to /u/Kaargo for the suggestion)</li>
              <li>A countdown timer for how long the cycle has left for all buildings that has a cycle longer than 20 seconds. (Thanks to /u/ettredditnamn, /u/Farbror_Frej, /u/engelMaybe and everyone who I unfortunately forgot, who suggested it)</li>

              <li>Added a new currency - Coins! These little suckers can be traded for various services, like extra confidence or free upgrades. You earn them by buying buildings and you keep them between resets.</li>
              <li>Removed the debates for citizen confidence. (Thanks everyone for the feedback!)</li>
              <li>Added the ability to turn on Scientific Notations in the settings, thanks /u/MyClitBiggerThanUrD for the suggestion</li>

              <li>Ironically the update "Remove all bugs", had a bug in it. It gave x3 money for all, instead of x13. Thanks to /u/borthelcash for bringing it to my attention.</li>
              <li>The citizens now have "confidence" in you. The confidence will steadily drop over a few hours, and will eventually get down to 0. You can add more confidence by debating it (the old political debates)</li>
              <li>Almost all upgrades under "city" has been recalulcated to match the new citizen confidence system.</li>
              <li>Reddit user /u/AutomaticHourglass pointed out that you can spoof the political Ideology, so you now require to set it in order to use it. It resets after every city restart so you can set it again.</li>

              <li>Removed the animated part on the CSS that bogged down the performance a lot.</li>
              <li>Removed cycle information if the timer is under 0.1 seconds.</li>

            <li>A Political Ideology slider has been implemented that affects the way the game is played. This is available as soon as you have hired all available politicians.

(Thanks /u/Splitzy for the idea)</li>    
            <li>The planning of your city now affects how the game is played. Depending on how you actually plan out your city.
